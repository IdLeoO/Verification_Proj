# Verification_Proj
In this project, a verification platform is built for the given DUT. The verification modules are designed based on the verification methodology using the System Verilog technique with proper understanding of the DUT. 

The codes for the modules are generated to implement the functions in order to achieve enough coverage of coverage test for six different tests. The simulation result verifies full coverage.
